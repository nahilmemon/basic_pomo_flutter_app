# basic_pomo_flutter_app

A very basic implementation of a pomodoro timer which uses Flutter and Firebase.
This app has the options to change the duration of the pomo and break timers and these settings are
saved in a separate entry for each user in a Firebase Database. This app also uses Firebase
Authentication to login and register new users.
